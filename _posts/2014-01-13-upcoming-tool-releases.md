Over the past few months and years, I've developed a number of tools
for forensic investigators. These are tools I've needed for
one reason or another, and actively used over many investigations.
Although I've mentioned some of them in passing at various points
(such as at 
[OSDFC](http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/165417/file-377400132-pdf/presentations/osdf-2013/Willi_Ballenthin.pdf), 
or in my 
[MFT analysis presentation](http://www.williballenthin.com/blog/2013/12/13/mft-analysis-presentation), 
many of the tools have never received a formal introduction or release. 
These posts change that.

I'll release the posts on this blog, and update this post as I 
publish them. Happy forensicating!
