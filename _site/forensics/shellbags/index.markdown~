Windows shellbag forensics
==========================

Microsoft Windows uses a set of [Registry
keys](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/813711) known as "shellbags" to
maintain the size, view, icon, and position of a folder when using
Explorer. These keys are useful to a forensic investigator. Shellbags
persist information for directories even after the directory is removed,
which means that they can be used to enumerate past mounted volumes,
deleted files, and user actions. Yuandong Zhu, Pavel Gladyshev, and
Joshua James provided a nice overview of the investigative value of
shellbags in ["Using shellbag information to reconstruct user
activities"](http://www.dfrws.org/2009/proceedings/p69-zhu.pdf) [pdf];
however, they do not describe how to programmatically access the data.
Allan S Hay went into greater detail in his December, 2004 document
["MiTeC Registry
Analyser"](http://mysite.verizon.net/hartsec/files/WRA_Guidance.pdf)
[pdf], although he also leaves out a thorough analysis of the format.
TZWorks provides an effective closed-source shellbag parser
[sbag](http://www.tzworks.net/prototype_page.php?proto_id=14), but does
not explain its algorithm. Yogesh Khatri first described the basic
structure of Windows Shell Items in his blog post for 42 LLC entitled
[Shell BAG Format Analysis](https://42llc.net/?p=385). Joachim Metz went
on to described the binary format of the Windows Shell Item structures
with great detail in [Windows Shell Item format
specification](http://download.polytechnic.edu.na/pub4/download.sourceforge.net/pub/sourceforge/l/project/li/liblnk/Documentation/Windows%20Shell%20Item%20format/Windows%20Shell%20Item%20format.pdf)
[pdf]. This page documents an approach to parsing shellbags in detail,
as well as introduces an open-source, cross-platform shellbag
[parser](#shellbags.py).

Shellbag locations
------------------

Shellbags may be found in a few locations, depending on operating system
version and user profile. On a Windows XP system, shellbags may be found
under:

-   HKEY\_USERS\\{USERID}\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Shell\\
-   HKEY\_USERS\\{USERID}\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\ShellNoRoam\\

The `NTUser.dat` hive file persists the Registry key
HKEY\_USERS\\{USERID}\\.

On a Windows 7 system, shellbags may be found under:

-   HEKY\_USERS\\{USERID}\\Local
    Settings\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Shell\\

The `UsrClass.dat` hive file persists the registry key
HKEY\_USERS\\{USERID}\\.

Shellbag Parsing
----------------

Let us begin with the Shell\\ key. The Shell\\ key does not have any
values. Under the Shell\\ key are two keys: Shell\\Bags\\ and
Shell\\BagMRU\\.

### FolderData

Each subkey under Shell\\Bags\\ is named as increasing integers from
one, such as Shell\\Bags\\1\\ or Shell\\Bags\\2\\. Let us call these
subkeys FolderData, since they each represent one item viewed in
Explorer, and this is usually a folder. FolderData subkeys do not have
any values, but often have subkeys. The most common subkey is
Shell\\Bags\\{Int}\\Shell\\, but there are a few other possibilities
(ComDlg, Desktop, etc.). The subkeys under a FolderData describe the
settings, position, and icon when viewing the folder in Explorer. In
particular, a Registry value whose name begins with ItemPos specifies
the location of the icons for a given desktop resolution. For example,
on my Windows 7 system, the Registry key HKEY\_USERS\\{USERID}\\Local
Settings\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Shell\\Bags\\6\\Shell\\{5C4F28B5-F869-4E84-8E60-F11DB97C5CC7}
has 12 values that record various configurations. This set includes the
value ItemPos1427x820(1) that has type `REG_BIN` with length 0x120:

With no tools beyond Regedit (or
[Regview.py](https://github.com/williballenthin/python-registry/blob/master/samples/regview.py)),
Windows 8.3 filenames (eg. MOZILL\~1.LNK) and Unicode filenames (eg.
Mozilla Firefox.lnk) stand out. Fortunately, by applying the formats
found in Joachim's paper, more details can be extracted. Throughout this
document, I refer to this Registry value type as an `ITEMPOS` value.

### ITEMPOS values

The `ITEMPOS` value's structure is a list of Windows File Entry Shell
Items (`SHITEM_FILEENTRY`) terminated by an entry whose size field is
zero. The list begins at offset 0x10. Items are preceeded by 0x8 bytes
whose meaning is unknown. The minimum size of a `SHITEM_FILEENTRY`
structure is 0x15 bytes, so entries whose size field is less than 0x15
should be skipped. The valid `SHITEM_FILEENTRY` items have the following
structure (in pseudo-C / [010 Editor
template](http://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/) format):

~~~~ {.prettyprint .lang-c}
typedef struct SHITEM_FILEENTRY {
        UINT16  size;
        UINT16  flags;
        UINT32 filesize;
        DOSDATE date;
        DOSTIME time;
        FILEATTR16 fileattrs;
    
        string short_name;
        if (offset() % 2 != 0) {
            UINT8 alignment;
        }
    
        UINT16 ext_size;
        UINT16 ext_version;
    
        if (ext_version >= 0x0003) {
            UINT16 unknown0; // == 0x0004
            UINT16 unknown1; // == 0xBEEF

            DOSDATE creation_date;
            DOSTIME creation_time;
    
            DOSDATE access_date;
            DOSTIME access_time;
    
            UINT32 unknown2;
        }
    
        if (ext_version >= 0x0007) {
            FILEREFERENCE file_ref;
            UINT64 unknown3;
            UINT16 long_name_size;
    
            if (ext_version >= 0x0008) {
                UINT32 unknown4;
            }
    
            wstring long_name;
            
            if (long_name_size > 0) {
                wstring long_name_addl;
            }
        }
        else if (ext_version >= 0x0003) {
            wstring long_name;
        }
    
        if (ext_version >= 0x0003) {
            UINT16 unknown5;
        }
    
        UINT8 padding[size - (offset() - offset(size)];
    }
} SHITEM_FILEENTRY;
~~~~

`FILEREFERENCE` is a 64bit MFT file reference structure (48 bits file
MFT record number, 16 bits MFT sequence number). `FILEATTRS` is a 16 bit
set of flags that specifies attributes such as if the item is read-only
or a system file. Applying this template to the `ITEMPOS` Registry
value, we see there are four list items: one invalid entry, and three
`SHITEM_FILEENTRY` items.

    00 00 00 00  --> header/footer
    00 00 00 00  --> unknown padding (item position?)
    00 00 00 00  --> invalid SHITEM_FILEENTRY
    00 00 00 00  --> SHITEM_FILEENTRY

Taking the first valid entry from offset 0x34, let's parse out the
fields from the binary. The following block visually maps out the
relevant bytes, while the table translates each field into a human
readable value.

At this point, it is easy to write parser that explores the FolderData
keys under the Shell registry key. For each FolderData, the parser might
enumerate each `ITEMPOS` value and consider the binary blob. By applying
the binary template above, the tool could identify filenames, MAC
timestamps, and other metadata independent of the filesystem MFT.
Unfortunately, we're still missing a key piece of information: the full
file path.

### BagMRU tree

To recover file paths from Shellbags, we'll need to consider the
Registry keys under BagMRU. The subkeys under Shell\\BagMRU form a
recursive, tree-like structure that mirrors the file system on disk.
Shell\\BagMRU is the root of the tree. Each subkey is a node
representing a folder, and like a folder, may contain children nodes.
Yet, unlike (most) folders, the nodes are named as increasing integers
from zero. For example, the branch Shell\\BagMRU\\0 might have the
children 0, 1, and 2.

All nodes in this tree have a value named MRUListEx, and many have a
value named NodeSlot. NodeSlot is what interests us, as it forms the
link between the filesystem tree structure and the FolderData keys. A
NodeSlot value has type `REG_DWORD` and should be interpreted as a
pointer to the FolderData key with the same name. For example, on my
workstation, the key Shell\\BagMRU\\1\\1\\3\\0 has a NodeSlot value of
144. This means that the FolderData Shell\\Bags\\144\\ corresponds to a
folder with a path of four components. What are they? The components are
described by the values at Shell\\BagMRU\\1, Shell\\BagMRU\\1\\1,
Shell\\BagMRU\\1\\1\\3, and Shell\\BagMRU\\1\\1\\3\\0.

### SHITEMLIST

In addition to the values MRUListEx and NodeSlot, nodes of the
Shell\\BagMRU tree have one value for each subkey. The values have the
same name as the subkey; since the subkeys are named as increasing
integers, so are the values. Each value records metadata about the
filesystem path component associated with the subkey. The values have
type `REG_BIN`, and have an internal binary structure known as an
`SHITEMLIST`. An `SHITEMLIST` is formed by contiguous items terminated
by an empty item. Practically, though, the `SHITEMLIST` of a BagMRU node
will have two entries: a relevant entry, and the empty terminator item.
The first two bytes of each `SHITEM` gives the item's size.

Joachim's paper on Window's shell items is the best resource for
understanding the variations among `SHITEM` entries. From a high level,
there are at least ten types of items that range from `SHITEM_FILEENTRY`
and `SHITEM_FOLDERENTRY` to `SHITEM_CONTTROLPANELENTRY`. For each of
these types, we can extract at least a path component such as "My
Documents" or "\\\\myserver". Fortunately, most items have type
`SHITEM_FOLDERENTRY`, which provides additional metadata including MAC
timestamps. A small number of items do not conform to the known
structure, although these do not usually contain any human readable
strings or hints.

### Putting it all together

With the `SHITEMLIST` structure in hand, we now have enough information
to comprehensively parse Windows shellbags. To do this, first recurse
down the Shell\\BagMRU keys while complete directory paths. At each
node, record any available metadata and lookup the associated
FolderData. Recall that the FolderData may indicate some of the items
contained by the directory, so record this metadata, too. Finally,
format and enjoy!

The following code block lists the algorithm in a Pythonish language for
the programmers in the room.

Shellbags.py
------------

Using these concepts, I've implemented a cross-platform shellbag parser
for Windows XP and greater in the Python programming language. The code
is freely available
[here](https://github.com/williballenthin/shellbags), so all algorithms
and structures are accessible to interested parties. I've licensed the
code under the Apache 2.0 license, so please feel encouraged to take and
improve the routines as you feel fit. As a benchmark, shellbags.py tends
to identify at least the items returned by the
[sbag](http://www.tzworks.net/prototype_page.php?proto_id=14) utility,
and in some cases returns more.

[Shellbags.py](https://github.com/williballenthin/shellbags) accepts the
path to a raw Registry hive acquired forensically as a command line
argument. To ensure interoperability, output is formatted according to
the Bodyfile specification by default. The following block lists a
demonstration of me running shellbags.py against a Windows XP
`NTUSER.dat` Registry hive.
