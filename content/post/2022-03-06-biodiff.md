[biodiff](https://github.com/8051Enthusiast/biodiff) is a binary diffing tool by [@8051enthusiast](https://twitter.com/8051enthusiast).
You can use this tool to identify additions, removals, and changes between two files, even if they're not text files.
I anticipate this to be useful during malware analysis, such as to highlight configuration changes among variants of the same malware family.

In the past, I've used [010 Editor](https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/) for this; however, it requires a lot of pointy-clicky GUI interactions.
biodiff may be a better fit for strictly diff-ing within a terminal.


### example: finding malware configuration changes

Imagine you've recovered two similar-looking malware payloads during an incident:

| filename    | size (bytes) | magic                                         |
| ----------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| [virus.exe](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bd960ceb2ea4dc5f16988120d8e710a7f7e7990a7adf51c3292aa64f1bc20061) | 7168         | PE32+ executable (GUI) x86-64, for MS Windows |
| [hacker.exe](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/6614fcdf514992b7199d7e6643b924ad340ccd258dcd4779a4b330e4a80bad2a) | 7168         | PE32+ executable (GUI) x86-64, for MS Windows |

You do a quick triage and see that they have a similar structure, by using `objdump` to enumerate sections, etc. and comparing the reports:

![image alt text](/img/biodiff3.jpg)

This shows two differences:
  - the PE header checksum
  - the first section name

However, `diff objdump` doesn't explain if/how the code differs.

You can approximate a content comparison by diffing the strings of the two files,
but there are obvious reasons why this doesn't work well:
it only considers data with a human-readable representation, etc.
Still you can try it, though the results are not very useful:

![image alt text](/img/biodiff3.2pg)

This is a perfect time to use `biodiff`!
Here's what it looks like:

![image alt text](/img/biodiff1.jpg)

biodiff displays hex dumps of the two files side-by-side and highlights changes.
It found three differences:

  1. PE header checksum (known from `objdump`)
  2. the second section's name (known from `objdump`)
  3. six code changes around offset 0x1810 (new!)

Let's triage the code changes to see if any are meaningful.
Here is what biodiff shows:

![image alt text](/img/biodiff4.jpg)

Of those, the first five are instruction reorderings that we can ignore:

![image alt text](/img/biodiff5.jpg)

and the final is a *meaningful* change of an immediate constant:

![image alt text](/img/biodiff6.jpg)

With a bit more inspection (or perhaps by recognizing that these are Metasploit payloads)
you can realize that these constants are the `sin_port` and `sin_addr` fields of a `struct sockaddr_in`:

```c
struct sockaddr_in {
    short   sin_family;
    u_short sin_port;
    struct  in_addr sin_addr;
    char    sin_zero[8];
};
```

Which means that this final difference corresponds to the C2 server used by these backdoors.
You can decode them with a bit of python:

`11 5C C0 A8 01 21`:

```py

In [1]: import struct, socket

In [2]: struct.unpack_from("<H", bytes.fromhex("5B26"))[0]
Out[2]: 9819

In [3]: socket.inet_ntoa(bytes.fromhex("2F5F0DA8"))
Out[3]: '47.95.13.168'
```
