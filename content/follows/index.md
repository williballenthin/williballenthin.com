Here are the sources that I typically follow:

  - [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs) ([me](https://lobste.rs/~williballenthin))
  - Hacker News, via [The Brutalist Report](https://brutalist.report) that has minimal styling
  - content published via RSS ([feeds here](./williballenthin.opml)) via [my homepage](https://williballenthin.com/homepage/), including:
    - blogs
    - Mastodon accounts
    - GitHub releases
    - YouTube channels

I'd like to add "highly voted threads in Rust/Python/etc. Subreddits" to my RSS feeds, but I don't have a source for those yet.
