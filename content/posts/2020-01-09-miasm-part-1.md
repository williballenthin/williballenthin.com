With the turning of the decade, [Python 2.7 is unmaintained](https://pythonclock.org/).
This is as good time as any to review the frameworks and libraries that we rely upon - and possibly doing updates or refreshes.
For many years, I've reached for [vivisect](https://github.com/vivisect/vivisect) when I needed to programmatically disassemble a file.
Its pure Python (so easy distributable) and provides many features out of the box 
([disassembler](https://github.com/vivisect/vivisect/blob/5eb4d237bddd4069449a6bc094d332ceed6f9a96/envi/archs/i386/disasm.py),
 [emulator](https://github.com/vivisect/vivisect/blob/5eb4d237bddd4069449a6bc094d332ceed6f9a96/envi/archs/i386/emu.py),
 [debugger](https://github.com/vivisect/vivisect/tree/5eb4d237bddd4069449a6bc094d332ceed6f9a96/vdb), and 
 [symbolic analysis](https://github.com/vivisect/vivisect/tree/5eb4d237bddd4069449a6bc094d332ceed6f9a96/vivisect/symboliks)).
Unfortunately, its strictly py2 with [few signs of change](https://github.com/vivisect/vivisect/pull/163).

[miasm](https://github.com/cea-sec/miasm) seems like a promising alternative that supports Python 3.x.
[In their words](https://github.com/cea-sec/miasm/blob/a46acb0c8e2af5343a1c94bc179e07f51e9b7c79/README.md):

I'm going to explore miasm and see if it offers features that I'd find useful as a reverse engineer.
As I have time, I'll post notes, code snippets, impressions, and conclusions.


### Things I probably want

I work as a reverse engineer on the [FLARE team](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/07/announcing-the-sixth-annual-flare-on-challenge.html) analyzing malware and building tools.
Therefore, I value:

  - pure Python code, so that I can easily distribute via PyPI package manager and/or PyInstaller executables
  - 32- and 64-bit Intel architecture, Windows platform, and PE format analysis, because that's what I usually deal with
  - flexibility to deal with both well-known and novel obfuscation
  - operations:
    - parse file formats into structures
    - read data from addresses, via RVA and EA / VA
    - disassemble regions and functions
    - navigate code and data cross references
    - emulate sequences of instructions

While other languages and frameworks may have better performance, Python is a language that many of my colleagues are familiar with.
I'm willing to tolerate performance within approximately an order of magnitude of IDA Pro or vivisect.

In the back of my mind, I'm wondering if we could port [FLOSS](https://github.com/fireeye/flare-floss) to miasm so that we can get all the benefits of py3.


### Installation

To install: 

```sh
$ pip install https://github.com/cea-sec/miasm/zipball/master pyparsing
```

This installs miasm directly from the master branch on Github.
You could install from PyPI like `pip install miasm==0.1.3`, but master has a few recent fixes for Windows/PE that look nice
([1](https://github.com/cea-sec/miasm/commit/6bfa31c2998db8cef2f4be13eb77d3c83f5afe06),
 [2](https://github.com/cea-sec/miasm/commit/28d9cf7fd18c899688b55c58dfae049fe2d3fe63),
 [3](https://github.com/cea-sec/miasm/commit/3a0d984146e8b3428c4445d37709f2af9d98fb5a),
 [4](https://github.com/cea-sec/miasm/commit/0f867b44e05b3a0422d0d4348e969caa222e8a50)).

Although miasm supports native libraries (LLVM, GCC, and Z3) to enable better performance, we'll ignore that for now.


### Parsing a PE file

You can load a PE file into miasm like this:

```python
import miasm

with open('kernel32-32.dll', 'rb') as f:
    buf = f.read()

pe = miasm.analysis.binary.Container.from_string(buf)
```

I used `Container.from_string()` rather than `Container.from_stream()` because I often analyze samples that I never save to my hard drive (e.g. unpacked by a script or fetched via network).
I wonder if using `from_stream()` consumes fewer resources because large files are not slurped into memory?

Accessing the entry point is easy:

```python
assert pe.entry_point == 0x6b81fd70
```

This appears to be a property that is available across different file formats.


#### enumerating imports

Miasm provides low level access to the parsed PE file.
If you're familiar with it, then you can fetch the raw data:

```python
dll = pe.executable.DirImport.impdesc[0]
assert dll.dlldescname.name.decode('ascii') == 'api-ms-win-core-rtlsupport-l1-1-0.dll'

imp = dll.impbynames[0]
assert imp.name.decode('ascii') == 'RtlCaptureStackBackTrace'
```

On the one hand, this requires more specific handling than something like IDAPython, where the following works for many file formats:

```python
import idaapi

imports = []
for i in range(0, idaapi.get_import_module_qty()):
    dll = idaapi.get_import_module_name(i)
    if not dll:
        continue

    def imp_cb(ea, name, ord):
        if name:
            imports.append((dll, name))
        else:
            imports.append((dll, ord))
        return True

    idaapi.enum_import_names(i, imp_cb)

assert imports[0] == ('api-ms-win-core-rtlsupport-l1-1-0.dll', 'RtlCaptureStackBackTrace')
```

On the other hand, miasm lets you 1) easily access the raw data, and 2) specialize your handling of edge cases.
I found this to be a recurring pattern with miasm: 
 it provides low level tools that require a bit more effort up front, but also enable more flexible analysis.

If you'd prefer a higher-level API, then you can use the routines found in `miasm.jitter.loader.pe`.
For example, `get_pe_dependencies` fetches the DLLs upon which the PE depends:

```python
imported_dlls = miasm.jitter.loader.pe.get_pe_dependencies(pe.executable)
assert sorted(imported_dlls)[0] == 'api-ms-win-core-appcompat-l1-1-0.dll'
```

And `get_import_address_pe` computes the addresses of imported symbols:

```python
imports = miasm.jitter.loader.pe.get_import_address_pe(pe.executable)
assert sorted(imports.keys)[0] == ('api-ms-win-core-appcompat-l1-1-0.dll', 'BaseCheckAppcompatCache')
assert imports[('api-ms-win-core-appcompat-l1-1-0.dll', 'BaseCheckAppcompatCache')] == 0x6b880c48
```


#### enumerating exports

Likewise, for exports, miasm provides the tools for you to parse the data structures semi-manually.
In this case, we need to walk a couple lists, handling some edge cases (such as forwarded exports) along the way.

Here's the wrapper function I've been using:

```python
import collections
Export = collections.namedtuple("Export", ["ordinal", "names", "rva", "is_forwarded"])

def get_exports(pe):
    directory_entry_export = pe.executable.NThdr.optentries[miasm.loader.pe.DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT]
    export_directory_range = (directory_entry_export.rva, directory_entry_export.rva + directory_entry_export.size)

    # ref: https://github.com/cea-sec/miasm/blob/master/miasm/loader/pe.py#L740
    exported_names = [[] for _ in range(pe.executable.DirExport.expdesc.numberoffunctions)]
    for i, entry in enumerate(pe.executable.DirExport.f_names):
        exported_names[pe.executable.DirExport.f_nameordinals[i].ordinal].append(entry.name)

    exports = []
    for i, entry in enumerate(pe.executable.DirExport.f_address):
        if not entry.rva:
            continue

        exports.append(Export(
            ordinal=i + pe.executable.DirExport.expdesc.base,
            names=exported_names[i],
            rva=entry.rva,

            # forwarded exports can be identified by checking if 
            # the target address falls within the export table
            # (and it will dereference to an ASCII string).
            # ref: https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/21110/17194
            is_forwarded = export_directory_range[0] <= entry.rva < export_directory_range[1]
        ))
    return exports
```

You can use it like this:

```python
assert str(get_exports(pe)[0]) == "Export(ordinal=1, names=[<DescName=b'BaseThreadInitThunk'>], rva=131424, is_forwarded=False)"
```

One thing I think is cool is how miasm's approach 
(derived from their [repr routine](https://github.com/cea-sec/miasm/blob/6bfa31c2998db8cef2f4be13eb77d3c83f5afe06/miasm/loader/pe.py#L742-L750))
encouraged me to prepare for multiple exported names to point to the same address (ordinals, too).
See how the `name` field is a list of names, rather than single, inline string?
Surely I would have eventually remembered this case the hard way, so I appreciate that the framework guided me away from a potential bug.

I don't really like how some symbols are named inconsistently.
For example, we see camel case in `DirExport`, snake case in `f_name`, smooshed words in `numberoffunctions`, and semi-shorted words in `expdesc`.
I've been using a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) with tab completion heavily to understand what fields are availble.

Also, we can use the high-level routines in `miasm.jitter.loader.pe` to fetch exports:

```python
exports = miasm.jitter.loader.pe.get_export_name_addr_list(pe.executable)
assert exports[0] == ('AcquireSRWLockExclusive', 0x6b89b22a)
```


#### enumerating sections

It's easy to enumerate sections using the raw parsed structures:

```python
for section in pe.executable.SHList.shlist:
    name = section.name.partition(b'\x00')[0].decode('ascii')
    va = section.addr
    size = section.size
    print(name, hex(va), hex(size))
```

I haven't found a higher-level API that automatically decodes the section names, yet.


### Conclusion

This is the first set of notes.
Next, I'll share how I learned to disassemble instructions in an executable and recognize functions.
Maybe we'll get to emulation (haven't attempted this yet).

Overall, I'm happy with miasm for a few reasons:
  - the PE parser seems fairly thorough and exposes its internals to the user
  - documention and docstrings are sometime present, for example, see [locationdb.py](https://github.com/cea-sec/miasm/blob/944806c506446c918eb74c17a605f5f56d4b75e0/miasm/core/locationdb.py#L17-L57)
  - code style is consistent and easy to understand
  - no bugs encountered yet
